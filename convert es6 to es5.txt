Convert ES6 code to ES5 using Babel compiler. Babel is a JavaScript compiler. (http://babeljs.io/) 
Requirement : You have latest version of node and npm. Any editor like Atom, visual studio code etc. 

Steps :
1.Create a directory called 'Demo' 

2.Create package.json file For that we use npm npm init So open terminal and run this command 

3.Create a directory called 'es6' 

4.Create a directory called 'es5' 

5.Create main.js file into es6 directory 

6.open terminal , you can also use git bash or command line. In Visual studio code short cut key for opening terminal is ctrl+` 

7.Check your node version which is latest or not. 
   Using node -v command. 
   If your node version not latest then download from https://nodejs.org/en/ 
   Also check npm using npm -v command. If not latest then update using npm install npm@latest -g command. 

8.Now install babel-cli and babel-preset-es2015 packages
  npm install babel-cli babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev 

9.Create a .babelrc configuration file Add below json into it. 
  { "presets":[ "es2015" ] } 

10.When we run then we need main.js file into converted es6 to es5 into directory So we have to add scripts build section into package.json file. 
   "scripts": { "build": "babel es6 -d es5" }, "scripts": { "build": "babel --presets es2015 es6 -d es5" } 

11.Write some sample code into main.js let test='hello'; 

12.build a sample code 
   npm run build 
               Compare both code which is same :) Now check es5/main.js , 
   its shows converted code. You can check e6 compatibility with different browser for that use
